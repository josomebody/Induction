Induction -- Episode I: Cognition

The long-distance run was just the beginning. You find yourself in a paper town somewhere south of nowhere in the middle of Kentucky, facing a gauntlet of brain teasers designed to suffocate, gas, and blow up the errant hopeful. Discover the secrets of the initiates of the Order of the Flood, find the origin of the Minotaur, pick locks with mind-numbing realism. Fight the parser, beat your head against a wall, and don't forget to think, and everything will be alright.

Opening tips: Save often, don't be afraid to die, collect achievements, and seriously, think!
